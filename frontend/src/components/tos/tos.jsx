        <p className="text-white font-bold leading-6">
          Bloxyspin.com is an entertainment platform that uses a virtual
          currency ("Virtual Currency") for in-game activities. This Virtual
          Currency has no real-world value and cannot be bought, sold, or
          exchanged for real money or other assets. It is intended solely for
          use within the Service.
          <br />
          By using the Service, you agree that all Virtual Currency, virtual
          items, and rewards are purely fictional and hold no monetary value.
          They are designed for entertainment purposes only and cannot be
          converted into real-world currency, goods, or services. Any attempt to
          trade, sell, or exchange these items for real-world value is strictly
          prohibited and may result in account suspension or termination.
          <br />
          Bloxyspin.com does not support or facilitate real-money gambling. All
          activities on the platform are simulated and meant for recreational
          use. While some games may involve chance, the outcomes have no
          real-world financial implications. These activities are similar to
          arcade games and are not connected to actual gambling.
